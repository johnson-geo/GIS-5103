    "1.      (Almost) everything is an object.\n",
    "2.      Computation is performed by objects communicating with each other, requesting that other objects perform actions.  Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages.  A message is a request for action, bundled with whatever arguments may be necessary to complete the tasks.\n",
    "3.      Each object has its own memory, which consists of other objects.\n",
    "4.      Every object is an instance of a class.  A class simply represents a grouping of similar objects, such as integers or lists.\n",
    "5.      The class is the repository for behaviour associated with an object.  That is, that all objects that are instances of the same class can perform the same actions.\n",
    "6.      Classes are organized into a singly rooted tree structure, called the inheritance hierarchy.  Memory and behaviour associated with instances of a class are automatically available to any class associated with a descendant in this tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    " \n",
    "1.      Modularity: The source code for a class can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other classes. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.\n",
    "2.      Information-bundling: By interacting with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain contained, separate from the outside world.\n",
    "3.      Code re-use: If a class already exists, you can use objects from that class in your program. This allows programmers to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then use in your own code.\n",
    "4.      Easy Debugging: If a particular object turns out to be a problem, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.\n",

    "**Note**: Some programming languages pass arguments to functions **by value** and others pass **by reference**. The following description is overly simple, but it should get the point across. Pass by value essentially means that the language sends a copy of the thing into the function. Since it's a copy, you can mess with the thing all you want inside the function and nothing changes outside the function. Pass by reference essentially means that the language passes the location of the thing; this means that if the function changes the thing, it will be changed outside the function too. Here is an analogy from [Stack Exchange](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Say I want to share a web page with you.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If I tell you the URL, I'm passing **by reference**. You can use that URL to see the same web page I can see. If that page is changed, we both see the changes. If you delete the URL, all you're doing is destroying your reference to that page - you're not deleting the actual page itself.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If I print out the page and give you the printout, I'm passing **by value**. Your page is a disconnected copy of the original. You won't see any subsequent changes, and any changes that you make (e.g. scribbling on your printout) will not show up on the original page. If you destroy the printout, you have actually destroyed your copy of the object - but the original web page remains intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, python is neither pass by value nor pass by reference. However, you can generally think of Python as pass by reference: if you pass an object into a function, and change it within the function, then the object will be changed outside the function also. In the example above, inside the function `add_on` we're using the variable `my_list`, outside the function we're using the variable `new_list`; when we change `my_list` inside the function, it also changes `new_list` because they are the same object in RAM. Below is another example, not using functions."
