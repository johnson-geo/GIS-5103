Lowest numerical posted State Road number. FDOT roads are categorized as Interstate, U.S Route, State and County roads and are collectively called the "State Highway System"  (SHS). All SHS roads have a state road number, indicated with a prefix of SR. County roads are also included in this characteristic, with a prefix of CR. If a road transfers from the SHS, the State Road Number is changed to a County Road Number in the database by changing the SR prefix to OS (Old State Road Number). After one year, the OS is changed to CR.<table>

The RCI is a computerized database of physical and administrative data
related to the roadway networks that are either maintained by or are of
special interest to the Department. In addition to data required by the
Department, the RCI contains other data as required for special Federal and
State reporting obligations. The RCI is maintained by District and Central
Office personnel. While there are many other important databases
maintained by the Department (several that contain more highly technical
data such as bridge specifications, highway design, or pavement) the RCI
remains the largest database with over 1 million records.

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties
or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data
provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability
of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited
to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using,
modifying, contributing or distributing the materials.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<strong><b>DATA LINEAGE SUMMARY: </b></strong>
<br />
<table width="60%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
The data set was taken from the Florida Department of 
Transportation Statistics Office from the following webpage:  
http://www.dot.state.fl.us/planning/statistics/gis
The data set was originally downloaded in OCTOBER 2015 as the 
RCI basemap.  Specific instructions, created by URS 
Corporation and the GeoPlan Center, were carried out.
The data set is then to be updated on a regular basis. The 
data was originally in UTM Zone 17, Nad83, units meters.  
The data was projected to Albers HPGN.

-Download the most recent RCI GeoDatabase  
-Join the road status descriptions to the status event table
-Add a Route Event theme using the road status descriptions
-Add a Route Event theme using the local names
-Add a Route Event theme using the State Road Numbers
-Add a Route Event theme using the Federal Highway Numbers
-Add a description field to be associated with the Functional Classification 
values based on the following values:
FUNCLASS     DESCRIPT
00 = Roadway Feature
01 = Principal Arterial-Interstate - RURAL
02 = Principal Arterial-Expressway - RURAL
04 = Principal Arterial-Other - RURAL
06 = Minor Arterial - RURAL
07 = Major Collector - RURAL
08 = Minor Collector - RURAL
09 = Local - RURAL
11 = Principal Arterial-Interstate - URBAN
12 = Principal Arterial-Freeway and Expressway - URBAN
14 = Principal Arterial-Other - URBAN
16 = Minor Arterial - URBAN
17 = Major Collector - URBAN
18 = Minor Collector (Fed Aid) - URBAN
19 = Local - URBAN

-Add a Route Event theme using the FDOT Functional Classifications
-Select the primary route events from the "stroute Events" layer
-Select the primary route events from the "usroute Events" layer
-Use the ArcGIS Route Events GeoProcessing Wizard to merge all route events
-Export from Route Event to Shapefile
-Select the existing roadways from the "Roadway_road_status Events" layer
-Combine the "localnam Events" layer with the "stroute Events" layer
-Finally, add the following fields:
	USROUTE, text, 8
	STROUTE, text, 8
	RD_STATUS, text, 25
	LENGTH, double, precision 18, scale 11
-Delete the columns "ROUTE," "ROUTE2," and "DESCR2." 
-Project the shape file to the standard FGDL projection.  
-Update the Length field with the length (in meters) for each segment
-Create a shapefile without any remaining zero-length features.
