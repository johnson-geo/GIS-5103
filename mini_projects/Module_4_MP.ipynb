    "You will be analyzing a database of movie ratings for this exercise. The database is a little dated, but hopefully will still be interesting. While you could do this using any of the Python tools you've learned so far, Pandas will offer the most concise solution; so this is what we will use. This will also be the first exercise with a \"big\" dataset: there are over one million ratings, on approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 users.\n",
