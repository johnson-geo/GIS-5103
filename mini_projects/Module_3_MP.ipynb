    "### JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON or \"JavaScript Object Notation\" is a set of rules for organizing data. Although the word \"JavaScript\" is in the name, today it exists independent of that language. An alternative set of rules for organizing data is CSV or \"comma separated values\"; CSV is good for spreadsheets, which is why they tend to open nicely in Excel. JSON is more flexible than CSV and has become a standard for moving data around on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of what JSON looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[{ \n",
    "    \"id\" : 6543,\n",
    "    \"name\" : \"Jane Smith\",\n",
    "    \"age\" : 52,\n",
    "    \"degrees\" : [\"bachelors\", \"masters\", \"PhD\"],\n",

    "We will be using their API to pass commands to their GeoNames server that will result in it returning specific data back to us. GeoNames uses a RESTful API. RESTful APIs are based on the REST (representational state transfer) software architecture style, which leverages HTTP protocols (essentially the rules for creating a web address) to get the server to do something. The strength of this structure is that a user can simply construct a web address as a text string and does not need to understand how the server works. For this class you are only expected to understand the user side (not the server side) of this transaction. A [brief introduction to RESTful APIs](https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API).\n",
