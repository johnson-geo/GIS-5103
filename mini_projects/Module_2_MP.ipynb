    "### Package Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the [`geopy` package](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) this week. This package geocodes addresses\n",
    "and computes distances between points. Geocoding is the process of converting\n",
    "an address such as \"123 Main St, Anytown USA 01234\" into a latitude/longitude\n",
    "coordinate. There are many companies that provide online geocoding services via\n",
    "APIs, and `geopy` provides a single python interface that connects to many of\n",
    "them.  When computing distances, `geopy` can consider the curvature of the\n",
    "earth; this means that distances assume travel along the surface of curved\n",
    "object and not a straight line burrowing through the planet (i.e., Euclidean\n",
    "distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the package, open a new Terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows)\n",
    "and run the following line (note: you can run this from any directory; no need\n",
    "to `cd` anyplace before running the line): \n",
